					<h3>Summary</h3>

					<p>
						Surrealism was a cultural movement which developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I and was largely influenced by Dada. It began approximately in 1920. The movement is best known for its visual artworks and writings and the juxtaposition of uncommon imagery.

					</p>

					<h3>Aim</h3>

					<p>
						Surrealism aimed to revolutionise human experience, rejecting a rational vision of life in favour of one that asserted the value of the unconscious and dreams. The movement’s poets and artists found magic and strange beauty in the unexpected and the uncanny, the disregarded and the unconventional.

						Many surrealist artists used automatic drawing or writing to unlock ideas and images from their unconscious minds, and others sought to depict dream worlds or hidden psychological tensions.

						Attractive to writers, artists, photographers and filmmakers from around the world who shared this aggressive rejection of conventional artistic and moral values, surrealism quickly became an international movement. It exerted enormous impact on the cultural life of many countries in the interwar years and later.

					<h3>Characteristics</h3>

					<p>
						In Surrealism, the artist writes down their own thoughts without any stopping or structure, this is called automatic writing. The Juxtaposition of the forms in a surrealist painting is usually showing imagery to put irrelevant objects together. However, even though they may be irrelevant, Surrealists try to put association between the 2 objects of surrealism, using the unconscious, and rendering these associations with such Juxtapositions. A key characteristic of Surrealism is that the artist relies on their unconscious, but reality and the conscious combine with this state of consciousness when the unconscious finds a way to express the reality and render it into the canvases that these artists make. Some artists may use Dreams and Fantasy to make an expression of the reality, and this can create a Dreamlike drawing that has meaning, whilst others depend on simply where their subconscious brings them, just like in automatism.
